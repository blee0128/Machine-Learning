# Machine-Learning projects

## Exploration of machine learning libraries such as cv2 and matplotlib written in Python

In this mini-project,I often turn to Jupyter Notebook as my go-to environment for exploratory tasks and visual projects. Recently, I've been experimenting with computer vision and data visualization techniques. To do this, I've been leveraging the cv2 library for image processing tasks and matplotlib for visualizing the results
